# Bamazon-Project

Bamazon is a modern marketplace funcitoning on node. I used it to teach myself how to coordinate projects with mySQL as a database. While running the app you will be able to view a list of listed items for sale, and make bulk purchases.

This is the screen that welcomes you to Bamazon.

On it you are presented with 3 choices. View a list of items, place an order, or refusing to buy anything.

If you choose to view the current items in stock you will be presented with this list

After looking over the list you may then proceed to order if you see an item that catches your eye.

You must enter the ID for your specific product, and just to make sure noone gets blindsided by a incorrect input we ask to confirm the order. Once confirmation is reached we find out how much of the product you would like to order, before showing you an updated catalogue which is displayed in the image below

If you choose however to not be my customer, we give you the quick toss. After all, time is money!
